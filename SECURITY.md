# Security Practices - Dosimex Website

This document outlines the security practices implemented in the Dosimex website project.

## Security Audit History

### Task 7.2 - Dependency Security Audit (Completed: 2025-08-29)

#### Vulnerabilities Fixed

**Before Audit:**
- Next.js version: 13.5.11 (5 security vulnerabilities)
  - 2 HIGH: Server-Side Request Forgery & Authorization bypass
  - 1 MODERATE: Denial of Service in image optimization  
  - 2 LOW: Race condition cache poisoning & Information exposure

**After Audit:**
- Next.js upgraded to: 15.5.2 
- All vulnerabilities resolved: ✅ 0 vulnerabilities found

#### Dependencies Updated

1. **Next.js**: 13.5.11 → 15.5.2 (CRITICAL security update)
2. **FontAwesome React**: 0.2.3 → 0.2.6 (compatible security update)
3. **React Device Detect**: 1.17.0 → 2.2.3 (peer dependency compatibility)
4. **Next.js Image Configuration**: Added `qualities: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95]` for Next.js 15+ compatibility

## Current Security Practices

### 1. Dependency Management

- **Regular Audits**: Run `pnpm audit` regularly to identify vulnerabilities
- **Update Strategy**: Prioritize security updates while maintaining compatibility
- **Version Pinning**: Use exact versions for critical dependencies
- **Peer Dependencies**: Monitor and resolve peer dependency warnings

### 2. Environment Variables

- API keys and secrets stored in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- EmailJS credentials properly externalized:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` 
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

### 3. Build Configuration

- **Image Security**: Configured Next.js image optimization with controlled quality settings
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled to prevent type-related security issues
- **Import Restrictions**: Test files excluded from production builds
- **Bundle Analysis**: Available via `pnpm analyze` for security review

### 4. Code Quality

- **No `any` Types**: Strict TypeScript enforcement prevents type-related vulnerabilities
- **ESLint Rules**: Security-focused linting rules enabled
- **Error Boundaries**: Implemented to prevent information disclosure through error messages
- **Input Validation**: Form inputs properly validated (ContactForm)

## Security Checklist

### Before Each Release

- [ ] Run `pnpm audit` and resolve all HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run `pnpm test:run` - all tests must pass
- [ ] Run `pnpm check-types` - zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint:check` - zero warnings in CI mode
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Check `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Review bundle size with `pnpm analyze`

### Monthly Security Review

- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Audit third-party integrations (EmailJS, etc.)
- [ ] Check for new security advisories affecting project dependencies
- [ ] Review error logging to ensure no sensitive data exposure

## Dependency Security Matrix

| Package | Current Version | Security Status | Last Audit |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Next.js | 15.5.2 | ✅ Secure | 2025-08-29 |
| React | 18.3.1 | ✅ Secure | 2025-08-29 |
| FontAwesome | 0.2.6 | ✅ Secure | 2025-08-29 |
| EmailJS | 4.4.1 | ✅ Secure | 2025-08-29 |

## Vulnerability Response Process

1. **Discovery**: Automated via `pnpm audit` or security advisories
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact on application security
3. **Prioritization**: 
   - CRITICAL: Fix immediately (< 24 hours)
   - HIGH: Fix within 1 week
   - MODERATE: Fix within 1 month
   - LOW: Address in next major update
4. **Testing**: Verify fix doesn't break functionality
5. **Deployment**: Apply security patches to all environments
6. **Documentation**: Update this security document

## Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Services

- **EmailJS**: Client-side email service - API key is public by design
  - Risk: Limited to form submission functionality only
  - Mitigation: Service configured with usage limits and domain restrictions

### Client-Side Security

- **XSS Protection**: React provides built-in XSS protection via JSX escaping
- **CSRF Protection**: Not applicable for static site with client-side forms
- **Content Security Policy**: To be implemented in next security iteration

## Future Security Improvements

1. **Security Headers**: Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options in next.config.js
2. **Input Sanitization**: Add DOMPurify for user content sanitization
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting for form submissions
4. **Security Monitoring**: Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Integrate Dependabot or similar for automated updates
